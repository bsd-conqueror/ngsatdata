# SatData - a Python library for fetch space weather datasets

SatData has a machine-learning-ready unified API that allows you to fetch all
public available space weather datasets of a data center via its provided
driver.
Currently, only one driver by the Space Monitoring Data Center (SMDC -
http://smdc.sinp.msu.ru) of SINP MSU is
provided.

If you're interested in using SatData in your work, please send me an e-mail to
